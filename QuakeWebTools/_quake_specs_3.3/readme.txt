This document is entirely in HTML. You cannot read it conveniently
with an ordinary text editor. The entry points are:
 -	qkmenu.htm		(No frame version)
 -	qkframe.htm		(Frame version)

This specification, though not entirely complete, has been updated
to include the Quake networking specifications (including sample
session example, and informations about making bots).

This specificiation does NOT deal with Quake-C. For this, please read
the Quake-C specification, and the various Quake-C manuals.

Ps: if someone wants to take the time to convert this document to
LinuxDoc, it would be really appreciated.
