<H1><FONT COLOR="#007F00"><A NAME="APPB">Appendix B.</A> Table of
normal vectors</FONT></H1>

<P>This table is used in the <a href="qkspec_5.htm#CMDL0" target="content">Entity models</A> to code
the <a href="qkspec_5.htm#MD4" target="content">normal vector</A> of each vertex, in each frame
(the <TT>lightnormalindex</TT> value).</P>

<P>Since it doesn't seem to be derived from a regular polygon, there is
no known formula to calculate it, so we can only list here all the values.</P>

<P>Take care to normalise all those vectors to <TT>1</TT>, before using them.</P>

<P>To select the right vector from the list, just take the one whose
dot product with the actual normal vector of the vertex gives the
greater positive result. It's not too important that it differs a
bit from the actual normal vector of the vertex, Gouraud shading
tollerates a fair bit of imprecision.</P>


<P>Note: <I>since this table is defined in the QBSP source,
you had better get it from there (in file anorms.h). 
The table below was hacked out before QBSP was released.</I></P>
