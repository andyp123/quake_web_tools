<H2><FONT COLOR="#004F1F">1.3 <A NAME="CINTA">A word from the
authors</A></FONT></H2>

<P>This document is an updated version of the Unofficial Quake Specs
3.1, adapted for the Quake Shareware release. This release is not compatible
with the previous Quake Test1 release. The .BSP and .MDL file formats have
changed.</P>

<P>Though this document is largely the result of hacking, it has been checked
against the C code of the Quake utility. Some details could not be guessed by hacking.
But the C code is so... special, that it's sometime easier to look at the bytes.
</P>

<P>You will need some working knowledge of 3D geometry to understand
this specification, and a good deal of patience too, because some
(if not all) explanations may not be crystal clear.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<P>Please <EM>do not</EM> make any full-featured editor working with
the Quake shareware release.</P>
</FONT>

<P>Last, if you enjoyed editing Quake, don't forget to support <B>id
Software</B> and to buy their products. Help feed <B>John</B> and
<B>Mike</B> as they work on the next generation game engine!</P>

<P>Other sites will also have a copy of this document (according to
the <a href="qkspec_1.htm#CINTL" target="content">distribution rights</A> stated above) but we
cannot guarantee that those sites will have the most recent version.
Usually, we upload the new versions on <A HREF="http://www.stud.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/ftp-mirror/quake/docs/">www.stud.montefiore.ulg.ac.be</A>
first, then on the other sites on the same day.</P>
