<H2><FONT COLOR="#4F1F00">8.1 <A NAME="NETP">Generalities</A></FONT></H2>

<P>This is an incomplete description of the Quake Network Protocol used
in Quake version 1.01. The protocol used in Quake Worlds will probably be rather 
different, and hopefully much more optimised.</P>

<P>The network protocol described below is not derived from documents by
id software, so it's likely to be incomplete (or even wrong).
</P>

<P>The messages exchanged by the Quake client and servers are not really complex
to understand, but they are quite numerous, and of heterogeneous structure.
Please read the <a href="qkspec_8.htm#NETEXPL" target="content">example</A> of network session, before trying
to emulate a Quake client or server.
</P>


<P>Since the messages in the .DEM files have exactly the same format as some
of the network protocol messages, it is highly recommended that you also
take a look at the <a href="http://www.physik.uni-leipzig.de/~girlish/games/">DEM specs</a> 
by Uwe Girlich.</P>

<P>When describing the content of messages, we will use the same conventions
as in the DEM specs:
<PRE>
ReadString() = read a sequence of characters, terminated by NULL ('\0')
ReadAngle()  = read a byte, and multiply it by <TT>360.0 / 256.0</TT> to make it into degrees.
ReadChar()   = read a signed integer, on one byte.
ReadShort()  = read a signed integer, on two bytes, Big Endian order (Intel order).
ReadLong()   = read a signed integer, on four bytes, Big Endian order (Intel order).
ReadFloat()  = read a floating point number, on four bytes, Big Endian order (Intel order).
</PRE>
</P>


<H2><FONT COLOR="#4F1F00">8.2 <A NAME="NETCTRL">Control messages</A></FONT></H2>

<P>The structure of control messages is the following:
<PRE>
typedef struct
{ short Type=0x8000;           // (Little Endian) Type of message.
  short Length;                // (Little Endian) Length of message, header included. 
  char  message[Length-4];     // The contents of the message.
} MSGHEADER;
</PRE>
A control message, as opposed to a more ordinary <a href="qkspec_8.htm#NETGAME" target="content">game</A> message,
if characterised by the fact that <TT>Type & 0x8000</TT> is not zero (which means
that bit 15 is always set on a control message).
</P>
<P><B>Warning:</B> the fields <TT>Type</TT> and <TT>Length</TT> are in Little Endian order
(most significant byte first). To read them on an Intel processor, you must swap the higher
and lower bytes.
</P>

<P>The structure of the <TT>message</TT> fields is: a single-byte code, followed by
code-dependant informations. The following table details this information.
</P>

<P><I>Thanks to <a href="mailto:oliber@aiko.upd.edu.ph">A.Oliver</a> for the description
of the control requests 0x3, 0x4, 0x82, 0x84, 0x85 in the Unofficial Quake Network

<TR><TD> <TT>0x01</TT>
</TD><TD> <A NAME="MSGPART">Part of a Reliable Message</A>
</TD><TD> <i>This message must be acknowledged.</i><br>
	  When message that doesn't fit into a single network packet must be sent, it is split
          in as many parts as necessary. Each of these parts will be sent in order, as message
          type <TT>0x01</TT>, except the last part that will be sent as a message type <TT>Ox09</TT>.
</TD><TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>0x02</TT>
</TD><TD> <A NAME="MSGACK">Acknowledge of a Reliable Message</A>
</TD><TD> This message is sent by the recipient of a message type <TT>0x01</TT> or <TT>0x09</TT>,
          to confirm that the message was received correctly.
</TD><TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>0x09</TT>
</TD><TD> <A NAME="MSGEND">End of a Reliable Message</A>
</TD><TD> <i>This message must be acknowledged.</i><br>
          This is just like message type <TT>0x01</TT>, except that once the message is received,
          the whole message buffer can be interpreted.<BR>
          Note that if the message to be sent is small enough to fit into a single network packet,
          then it will be sent as a single message type <TT>0x09</TT>.
</TD><TR>
<TR><TD> <TT>0x10</TT>
</TD><TD> <A NAME="MSGUPDATE">Update Message</A>
</TD><TD> <i>This message must not be acknowledged.</i><br>
          The updates message are made of a single packet, and are usually very
          short (about 20 to 200 bytes).
</TD><TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>8.3.2 Usage of messages</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Reliable messages are used to send the game initialisation informations, that would
     crash the client if they were not received correctly. But that kind of message is
     not sent anymore, once game play has started.<br>
     The field <TT>Order</TT> is used to keep track of the order number of the last message
     sent, and to acknowledge a message received.
<LI> Update messages are used to send game update informations, like movement of entities,
     and movement of the player. They are the only messages used during game play, until
     the level ends.<BR>
     The fields <TT>Order</TT> is increasing by one with every message, but it doesn't seem
     to be used. Maybe it allows a Client to detect if a previous message has been lost, and
     should be repeated.
</UL>
</P>


<H3>8.3.3 Interpretation of the <TT>message</TT> contents</H3>

<P>The message content is made of a single byte code, followed by some code-dependent data,
and then followed by another byte code, and so on until the end of the message.
</P>
<P>That means you need to know how to interpret all the possible byte codes to read a
single message. That also means that if you make a mistake in the encoding of a single
code, then all the rest will be screwed up, and can eventually crash the game.
So trust it on luck!
</P>
<P>To make matter worse, the byte codes must be interpreted differently, wether the message
comes from a game <a href="qkspec_8.htm#NETSERVER" target="content">Server</A> or from a game <a href="qkspec_8.htm#NETCLIENT" target="content">Client</A>.
</P>


<H2><FONT COLOR="#4F1F00">8.4 <A NAME="NETCLIENT">Format of client messages</A></FONT></H2>

<P>This is the format of the <TT>message</TT> field, for messages sent by a game client.
This field is an unstructured set of bytes, that must be read one by one in order
to decode all the parts of the message.
</P>

<P>First, you should read one byte (the message code). Then, depending, on this code,
you must read zero or more bytes, depending on the code. That gives you one prt of
the message. To read the next part, read one byte, that gives you a code, and 
so on... until the end of the <TT>message</TT> field.</P>

<P>Stop at the first unrecognised code, it's no use to continue if you have
lost your marks.</P>

Impulse   = ReadChar();   
// Impulse command
</PRE>
</TD><TD>This message is sent when the player tries to move.<br>
All fields (except the angles) are zero by default, if the player doesn't move.<br>
The action time is usually some time in the near past, when the command was
issued. Action messages are often repeated with the same action time,
and then they all count for one message.<br>
The angles and speed are those desired by the player, but maybe
not those that the physic of the worl will allow. The player's angle, position and
velocity are controlled by the game server, not by the client, so the consequences
of a given movement attempt will only be known when the server sends an update.

<H3>8.4.2 About the player movement order</H3>

<p>The angles transmitted by a player movements are directly the angles set
by the player, whether via the mouse or via the look up/down keys. Note that
there is a flip angle indicated, but since no player command can possibly act
on it, it's always zero. Too bad... but this is not DESCENT.</p>

<p>The speed are ordinary signed integers, that seem to indicate a desired
speed in units per second. Experiment shows that when the player places an
order for +200 forward speed (typical run order), then the player accelerate,
until the speed stabilises at +200 coordinates per second (which makes it
10 coordinates per update, that happen every 20th of second).</p>

<p>This behavior proves that this parameter is a speed, <b>not</b> an 
acceleration. Well, this is a walking or swimming dude after all, not a ship
in the void. He's moving in a world where friction is preponderant.
Acceleration is only simulated, in the sense that you cannot change to
arbitrary speed values in no time. On ordinary ground, accelerations
seem limited to about 1000 to 15000 units/second².
</p>


<H2><FONT COLOR="#4F1F00">8.5 <A NAME="NETSERVER">Format of server messages</A></FONT></H2>

<P>The game messages sent by the Quake server are <b>exactly</b> the same as the ones
used in the demo files (.DEM), so they will not be repeated here. Look at the
DEM file specifications.</p>

<p>A single Quake server message contains exactly the same informations as those
contained in a .DEM file <b>block of messages</b>. That is rather logical, since
they certainly didn't create a new format just for the .DEM files, but used the
network protocol instead.
</p>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#4F1F00">8.6 <A NAME="NETEXPL">Network session example</A></FONT></H2>

<P>Here are some examples of how a Quake server and a Quake client interact.
They sumarise an <a href="session.htm">actual game session</a>, observed by 
intercepting the game packets.</P>


<H3>8.6.1 Request informations about the game</H3>

<P>Those messages are sent to and from the <TT>PUBLIC UDP PORT</TT> of 
the server (which is <TT>26000</TT> by default).
<pre>
Client sends a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLASKINFO" target="content">Request Informations</A> message,
	with game name <TT>QUAKE</TT>.
Server sends a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLGIVINFO" target="content">Give Informations</A> message,
        with indications on the current map, number of players...
</pre>
</p>

<p>Note: Those messages can be sent to interrogate a given Quake server,
without really disturbing it. Of course, if you flood a Quake server
with such messages, it might slow down.</p>


<H3>8.6.2 Establish a game session</H3>

<p>Those messages are sent to and from the <TT>PUBLIC UDP PORT</TT> of 
the server (which is <TT>26000</TT> by default).
<pre>
Client sends a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLCONNECT" target="content">Connect</A> message,
	with game name <TT>QUAKE</TT>.
Server sends an <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLACCEPT" target="content">Accept</A> message,
	containing the identifier of a <TT>PERSONAL UDP PORT</TT> for the client.
        Client now expects server message coming from the <TT>PERSONAL UDP PORT</TT>
</pre>
</p>
<p>Warning: after it replied with an <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLACCEPT" target="content">Accept</A> message,
the game server will only use a <TT>PERSONAL UDP PORT</TT> to communicate 
with a given client. The server <TT>PUBLIC UDP PORT</TT> is not used anymore
to talk to that client. It can only be used by clients that are not connected yet.

<H3>8.6.3 Prepare the client for the game (precache)</H3>

<PRE>
Server sends a big message that contains:
  - the server banner "VERSION 1.01 SERVER (21456 CRC)"
  - a server info message (code 0x0B) with map name, and precached models and sounds
  - an indication that client should move to PRESPAWN state.
Client sends a No Operation (code 0x01)
Client sends a console command (code 0x04) "prespawn", indicating prespawn is finished.
Server sends a big message that contains order to spawn static sounds and static entities
  - For all the static entities described in the .BSP file, 
     One "Spawn Static entity" order, and possibly a Static Sound order.
Client sends a player information message:
  - console order <b>"name PLAYER\n"</b> (where PLAYER is the player name)
  - console order <b>"color 0 0\n"</b>   (shirt and pants colors)
  - console order <b>"spawn "</b> to indicate the client is ready to play.
Server sends a big message:
  - For each possible player in the game (including those not connected):
     a set of orders UPDATE NAME, UPDATE FRAGS, UPDATE COLORS
  - For each of the 64 light style:
     a SET LIGHT STYLE message.
  - an UPDATE STATE message for total and found monsters and secrets
  - a SET ANGLE order, to orient the player's view
  - a CLIENT DATA order, fix the status bar display
  - an order to move to <b>Start 3d Rendering</b> state.
  - a last update NAMe, FRAGS, and COLORS, for the client.
Client sends a console message <b>"begin"</b>.
</PRE>


<H3>8.6.4 Run the game with the client</H3>

<PRE>
Every 50 milliseconds,
Server sends an update message, that contains:
  - an indication of the game time
  - a CLIENT DATA order, to fix the status bar display (mostly useless)
  - an UPDATE ENTITY order for each entity possibly in sight
     if the entity has not changed, only minimal informations will be sent.

Each time the player moves,
Client sends an update message containing:
  - a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CLIENTMOVE" target="content">movement</A> order.
</PRE>


<H2><FONT COLOR="#4F1F00">8.7 <A NAME="NETBOT">Making a fake client (aka Bot)</A></FONT></H2>

<p>These are only partial informations, but that should be enough for a start.</p>

<H3>Connecting the fake client and the Quake server</H3>

<p>Here is a simplified connection procedure, to register into a Quake server.
<ol>
<li> Client sends <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLCONNECT" target="content">Connect</a> message to the server,
  on his public port (usually 26000).
<li> Server replies with an <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CTRLACCEPT" target="content">Accept</a> message, that 
   contains the name of an UDP port that is dedicated to the client (usually
   in the range 1025-1200). 
<li> Now, to talk the the server, the client sends messages <b>only</b> to the 
  dedicated UDP port. The public UDP port becomes useless for the client.
<li> From now on, the client must <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGACK" target="content">acknowledge</A> all the 
 <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGPART" target="content">message parts</A> and <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGEND" target="content">message last parts</A>
 that are sent by the server, otherwise the server will repeat the same message 
 forever and no further progress will be made.
<li> The client waits for a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGEND" target="content">long message</A> that contains and order to 
  <a href="qkspec_8.htm#SERVERSIGNON" target="content">set the signon state</a> to 1 (prespawn). 
<li> Client sends a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGEND" target="content">message</A> containing a single 
    <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CLIENTORDER" target="content">Console</a> order:
<pre>

    <b>"name <i>player</i>\n"</b>   ('\n' is the return character)
    <b>"color <i>0 0</i>\n"</b>     ('\n' is the return character)   
    <b>"spawn "</b>          (there is white space at the end).

<li> From now on, the game is running, and the client starts receiving a flood
   of update messages.

<H3>The fake client at play</H3>

<p>How to send movement orders:
<ol>
<li> Server sends an <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGUPDATE" target="content">Update</a> message, containing entity

<p>How to send orders on the server console:
<ol>
<li> The client sends a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#MSGEND" target="content">reliable message</A> containing a 
  <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CLIENTORDER" target="content">Console</a> order.
</ol>
</p>

<p>A client receives no update for the entities not in sight, so you cannot
cheat and make some radar that sees through walls. BUT you can of course make
a simple bot that will turn immediatly toward any enemy coming in his back.
And will of course avoid any rockets, or even straffe out of the line of sight
of any hostile player.
</p>
<p> Beware that the client must rely on himself alone to guess the geometry of the
 room he is in. The best is of course to load the .BSP for the level, and to keep
 track of the position of every entities, so as to know which paths are possible,
 and which are not. But you will soon discover that the .BSP per se is not enough
 to code a good behavior for a Bot, because there is no trace of the links between
 the rooms.

<h3>Leaving the server</h3>

<p>Here is the cleanest way to leave the server:
<OL>
<LI> Client sends a <a href="qkspec_8.htm#CLIENTDISC" target="content">Disconnect</a> order.
</OL>
Of course, if a client hangs and stops emitting messages, the server
will kick him out after a few minutes. But please <b>be kind to the server</b>
and log off when you cannot emit anymore. That means that you should catch
any exception in your code, and send a disconnect order if it crashes.
